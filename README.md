# BackEnd-aws

Here is the backend of the website that we want to deploy on cloud during the session

# Backend Setup Guide

## Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create a .env file
# Copy the content from .env.example and paste it into your new .env file
# Replace the placeholder string for mongoDb_URL with your actual database connection string
# Keep the PORT value as it is
# Change the JWT secret key to your own secure value (it can be any string)

# 3. Start the backend server
node index.js

# Your backend is now running

```
